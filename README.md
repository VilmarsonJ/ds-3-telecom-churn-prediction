# ds-3-telecom-churn-prediction


## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for DIGICEL Haiti, a leading telecommunications provider. The goal is to build a machine learning classification model that identifies customers at high risk of leaving the company’s services. 

By leveraging historical customer data, including usage patterns, service plans, and billing information, the project aims to uncover patterns that indicate churn.

## DIGICEL is losing a significant number of customers to competitors, resulting in reduced revenue and higher acquisition costs. The company currently lacks a reliable way to identify at-risk customers proactively, making it challenging to implement targeted retention strategies before churn occurs.

As a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Specialist at DIGICEL, I am tasked with developing a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at high risk of churn. By providing these insights, I will enable DIGICEL’s marketing and retention teams to take targeted actions to reduce churn.

## ## The Data

The dataset for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Churn in Telecoms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset)
. It is provided in CSV format (inside a ZIP file) and contains customer account details, usage patterns, and service plans for a telecommunications company.
This dataset will be used throughout Phase 3 to explore, preprocess, and model customer churn, forming the basis for all analyses and predictions in the project.



## Methods
In this project, we adopt a predictive modeling approach focused on classification, leveraging historical customer data to identify those at risk of churn. The goal is to build robust machine learning models that provide actionable insights, enabling targeted retention strategies and data-driven business decisions.

This project follows a predictive modeling approach to classify customers at risk of churn. The main steps are:

Data Preprocessing
Prepare and clean the data for modeling.

Modeling
Develop and tune classification models to predict churn.

Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using key metrics and compare results.

Insights and Recommendations
Identify drivers of churn and provide actionable business recommendations.


## Business Understandin

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Accurately identifying at-risk customers allows the company to implement targeted retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and reduce revenue loss. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage, the project provides actionable insights to retain customers and maximize their lifetime value.
